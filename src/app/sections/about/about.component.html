        <p class="description">
          A creator at heart, a developer by profession. I love building smooth user experiences, pixel-perfect layouts,

      <h2 class="section-heading">🚀 My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Starting from crafting static HTML pages in college to engineering large-scale enterprise apps, I've come a long way.
        Over the years, I've worked on IoT dashboards, design tools, e-commerce platforms, and experimental mobile features
        like face authentication and QR logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drives me? The <strong>joy of shipping quality products</strong> that look great, feel intuitive, and perform flawlessly.

    <div class="philosophy">
      <h2 class="section-heading">🎨 My Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        For me, frontend is more than UI — it's where design meets engineering. From managing state and performance to building
        design systems and micro-interactions, I believe in balancing <strong>craft and code</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in clean code, smart reusability, accessibility-first thinking, and the magic of minimalistic design.
